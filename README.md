https://blog.rapid7.com/2019/09/06/initial-metasploit-exploit-module-for-bluekeep-cve-2019-0708/

How To use:

Simply make folder named rdp (for convenience) in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/windows/
paste this exploit file(cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce.rb) in the folder(rdp) and use ur metasploit skills

Also replace the files in following folders:-
rdp.rb --> /usr/share/metasploit-framework/lib/msf/core/exploit/

rdp_scanner.rb --> /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/auxiliary/scanner/rdp

cve_2019_0708_bluekeep.rb --> /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/auxiliary/scanner/rdp


like:
use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce

and then ur general concepts of setting rhosts,lhost,payload etc

Thanks to the Genius Group of People for their wonderful work

HOW TO MAKE THE EXPLOIT WORK 100% OF THE TIME:

############################

You have to set the GROOMSIZE as show below with different combinations and error
Also my VMWARE(15) windows hardware was 2GB RAM and 1 Core processor

Conclusion setting GROOMSIZE to 50 worked as good as gold
